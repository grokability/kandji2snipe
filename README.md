# kandji2snipe

## About

This `python3` script leverages the [Kandji](https://kandji.io) and [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com) APIs to accomplish two things:
* Sync device details from Kandji to Snipe-IT
* Sync asset tags from Snipe-IT to Kandji.

## Overview:
kandji2snipe is designed to sync assets between your Kandji and Snipe-IT instances. The tool searches for assets based on the serial number, not the existing asset tag. If assets exist in Kandji and are not in Snipe-IT, the tool will create an asset and try to match it with an existing Snipe-IT model. This match is based on the device's model identifier (ex. MacBookAir7,1) being entered as the model number in Snipe-IT, rather than the model name. If a matching model isn't found, it will create one.

When an asset is first created, it will fill out only the most basic information. If the asset already exists in your Snipe-IT inventory, the tool will sync the information you specify in the settings.conf file and make sure that the asset tag in Kandji matches the asset tag in Snipe-IT, where Snipe-IT's asset tag for that device is considered the authority.

If the asset tag field is blank in Kandji when the record is being created in Snipe-IT, the script will create an asset tag with `KANDJI-$SERIAL_NUMBER` unless you enable `use_custom_pattern` in your `settings.conf` file.

### API Mapping

To get the database fields for Snipe-IT Custom Fields, go to Settings and then Custom Fields inside of your Snipe-IT instance, scroll down past Fieldsets to Custom Fields, click the column selection button and make sure the 'DB Field' checkbox is checked. Copy and paste the DB Field name for Snipe-IT under *platform*-api-mapping sections in your `settings.conf` file.

To get the API mapping fields for Kandji, refer to Kandji's [Device Details](https://api-docs.kandji.io/#efa2170d-e5f7-4b97-8f4c-da6f84ba58b5) API example response.

Some example API mappings can be found below:

- MAC Address:		`_snipeit_<your_mac_address_custom_field_id> = general mac_address`
- IPv4 Address:		`_snipeit_<your_IPv4_custom_field_id> = general ip_address`
- Blueprint Name:		`_snipeit_<your_blueprint_custom_field_id>_ = general blueprint_name`
- FileVault Status:		`_snipeit_<your_filevault_enabled_custom_field_id> = filevault filevault_enabled`
- Kandji Device ID:			`_snipeit_<your_device_id_custom_field_id> = general device_id`

You need to set the `manufacturer_id` for Apple devices in the `settings.conf` file. You can grab the `manufacturer_id` in Snipe-IT by going to Manufacturers > click the column selection button > select the `ID` checkbox.

## Usage
```
usage: kandji2snipe [-h] [-l] [-v] [-d] [--dryrun] [--version] [--auto_incrementing] [--do_not_update_kandji] [--do_not_verify_ssl] [-r] [-f] [-u] [-uns] [--mac | --iphone | --ipad | --appletv]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help              Shows this help message and exits.
  -l, --logfile           Saves logging messages to kandji2snipe.log instead of displaying on screen.
  -v, --verbose           Sets the logging level to INFO and gives you a better idea of what the script is doing.
  -d, --debug             Sets logging to include additional DEBUG messages.
  --dryrun                This checks your config and tries to contact both the Kandji and Snipe-IT instances, but exits before updating or syncing any assets.
  --version               Shows the version of this script and exits.
  --auto_incrementing     You can use this if you have auto-incrementing enabled in your Snipe-IT instance to utilize that instead of using KANDJI-<SERIAL NUMBER> for the asset tag.
  --do_not_update_kandji  Does not update Kandji with the asset tags stored in Snipe-IT.
  --do_not_verify_ssl     Skips SSL verification for all Snipe-IT requests. Helpful when you use self-signed certificate.
  -r, --ratelimited       Puts a half second delay between Snipe-IT API calls to adhere to the standard 120/minute rate limit
  -f, --force             Updates the Snipe-IT asset with information from Kandji every time, despite what the timestamps indicate.
  -u, --users             Checks in/out assets based on the user assignment in Kandji.
  -uns, --users_no_search Doesn't search for any users if the specified fields in Kandji and Snipe-IT don't match. (case insensitive)
  --mac                   Runs against Kandji Mac computers only.
  --iphone                Runs against Kandji iPhones only.
  --ipad                  Runs against Kandji iPads only.
  --appletv               Runs against Kandji Apple TVs only.

```

## Testing

It is recommended that you use a test/dev Snipe-IT instance for testing and that your backups are up to date. You can spin up a Snipe-IT instance in Docker pretty quickly ([see the Snipe-IT docs](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/docker)).

If you do not have a test/dev Kandji tenant, you can test kandji2snipe using the `--do_not_update_kandji` argument to prevent data being written back to Kandji.
